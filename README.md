###flavorNotes - An interactive Journal for the Creative Cook

This project aims to creative a digital space for exploring creativity and keeping track of progress in cooking.  

Making use of FoodPairing's API, the central functionality is a flavor matching tool. FoodPairing offers a wealth of data on ingreidents and their complements, giving each pairing a a number between 0 and 1 to indicate the strength of the aromatic relationship. More about their research and data can be found at their [website](www.foodpairing.com). 

I want to represent the relationships between flavors visually, adjusting color and opacity to reflect categroies of food that ingredients belong to and subqeuently the strength of their relationship to selected foods.  The user will be able to save pairings and pass them along to a second functionality of the app (not yet developed), which will be a recipe development journal.
